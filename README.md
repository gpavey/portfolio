Portfolio site
=========

This is the portfolio website of Geoff Pavey

  - It is was hand coded.
  - The site was done with HTML, CSS and Angular.js
  - It has a little parallaxing thrown in for fun.



>The overriding design goal for site was to make it as clean as possible.
The main index.html handles the header and footer that are displayed on every page. The links to the various projects are all created with ng-repeat and all of the pages live in a partials folder.  I tried to break everything out to make the code easier to read.



Version
----

2.0
The first version was written without angular and was not very DRY.  I like this much better

Tech
-----------

The site uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - used for testing
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework
* [angular.js] - awesome javascript mvc framework
* [jQuery] - duh
