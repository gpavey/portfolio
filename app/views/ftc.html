        <h5><strong>THE PROBLEM</strong></h5>
        <p><small>Its not very easy to figure out who you local constituents are and if they might be sympathetic to your cause.  The data is out there but its spread out on many different databases. The challenge was to make it all come together in an understandable way. </small></p>

      <div class="col-sm-6 text left">
        <h5><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong></h5>
        <p><small>I wanted a clean look and feel to the website.  I wanted it easy to use with no external noise to get in the way of the data.  Multiple API calls were used to different databases.  That data was then manipulated and fed into the the graphing software I used on the last page.   </small></p>
